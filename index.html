<h1>Thinking concurrently</h1>
<article>
  <p>Spawnfest is a 48 hour Erlang development competition where you can compete against other developers in building the best, most breathtaking Erlang application, library or anything you like!</p>
  <p>We hope Spawnfest will help bring the Erlang developer community together and get people interested in our favorite programming language</p>

<h1>It was a blast!</h1>
<article>
  <p>Needless to say, it was an intense weekend! We've got some great submissions. We're organizing transfer of qualified entries to the judges and expect results to be announced in two weeks or so. Stay tuned!</p>

<h1>Some numbers</h1>
<article>
  <p>We had about 60 teams signed up, 40 teams that proceeded to the actual contest and, as a result, over 20 judicable entries — good numbers for the first run. We do hope to get more contestants next time, though!</p>
