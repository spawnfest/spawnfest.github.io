<h1>Thinking concurrently</h1>
<article>
  <p>Spawnfest is a 48 hour Erlang development competition where you can compete against other developers in building the best, most breathtaking Erlang application, library or anything you like!</p>
  <p>We hope Spawnfest will help bring the Erlang developer community together and get people interested in our favorite programming language</p>

<h1>Some numbers</h1>

  <p>We had about 60 teams signed up, 40 teams that proceeded to the actual contest and, as a result, over 20 judicable entries — good numbers for the first run. We do hope to get more contestants next time, though!</p>
